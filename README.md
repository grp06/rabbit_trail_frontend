This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Environment Configuration

This app uses environment variables to configure the backend API URL.

### Local Development

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Production Deployment

When deploying to Vercel, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable to your deployed backend URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
```

You can set this in:

1. Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Or using Vercel CLI: `vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
